This configuration is solely focused on only the configuration of the k8s multinode cluster using ansible on the pre-launched ec2 instances.

Only Prerequisite is in your AWS account, EC2 instances must be already launched.

Configure the ansible invenotry file, and ansible.cfg file with the necessary details and you are good to go.

Hope this helps.

Happy ansible!!
